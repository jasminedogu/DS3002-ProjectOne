## DS3002-Project One: Shiny App 

This is Project One for my DS 3002 Course to make an ETL Data Processing Pipeline. I created my first Shiny app using R for this project. Detailed information regarding the dataset I used, what Shiny is, functionality, and more can be found here, https://jasdogu.medium.com/making-my-first-shiny-app-9182200c06d9
