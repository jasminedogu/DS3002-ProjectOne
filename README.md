# Looking at the World Happiness Report
## DS3002-Project One: Shiny App 


### What It Is:
This is Project One for my DS 3002 Course to make an ETL Data Processing Pipeline. I created my first Shiny app using R for this project. Detailed information regarding the dataset I used, what Shiny is, functionality, and more can be found here, https://jasdogu.medium.com/making-my-first-shiny-app-9182200c06d9


The interactive dashboard (Shiny App) can be found here, https://jasmine-dogu.shinyapps.io/ds3002-projectone/

### What Can It Do:
- View the World Happiness Report for all countries for the years 2005-2020
- Filter dataset by country, continent, and/or year
- View the number of rows and columns for the dataset (changes as restrictions/filter on dataset changes)
- View the statistical summaries for each variable (changes as restrictions/filter on dataset changes)
- Search bar to filter dataset
- Download original dataset or filtered dataset
- Can sort the dataframe by clicking the arrow next to the variable name
